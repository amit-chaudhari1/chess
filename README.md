# Chess.

Design Chess with following features:

- [ ] En passant
- [ ] Castling
- [ ] Computer Ai
  - [ ] Fights on a difficulty scale of 1-10.
  - [ ] Knows and uses commonly known opening strats.
  - [ ] Move calculation does not suck* (keep average case eval under a few seconds)
  - [ ] DO NOT USE outside help like pretrained models from github
- [ ] Ability to play two player mode, (user controls both sides)
- [ ] Ability to undo a move
- [ ] Ability to go forward moves.
- [ ] Confer with the existing chess engine (stockfish) results for move benchmarks
- [ ] Support FEN notation for describing a scenario
- [ ] Export scenario (Import but without validation)

Keep in mind that following features could be implemented in future (if i decide to keep working on this in future. chances low,)

- [ ] Multiplayer mode ??? (like multiplayer as in the other person on a different computer)
- [ ] Elo Ratings ???
- [ ] Learning mode, where one can learn from a library ???
- [ ] Tournament mode ???
- [ ] Elo graphs with time ???
- [ ] 3D mode? (idk I kind of already know some blender, the real pain could be tween animations for moves)
